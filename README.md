# SAX
SAX for Script Assisting X is a language of scripting, written in C

# Why this project?

I wan't to be able to add script for the [Engine](https://github.com/DipStax/Engine) i'm starting to build.
It's logicaly a part of the project, but this is too big to only be an issue.
There will be certainly no Issue open, or pull requests made on this repo. I will only work from different branches named:

- ID/TYPE/NAME

where ID will be the latest version of the code.
